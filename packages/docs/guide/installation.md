To use Avatars, you must install the library and at least one avatar style. Alternatively, you can use our HTTP API without installing anything.

## NPM

To install the library, run:

```
// with npm
npm install @avatars/core

// with yarn
yarn add @avatars/core
```

Please note that you must also install at least one avatar style.

## CDN

You can also load the library via CDN. You can use the following UDM files.

```html
<!-- For production -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@avatars/core@latest/umd/avatars.min.js"></script>

<!-- For development -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@avatars/core@latest/umd/avatars.js"></script>
```

Please note that you must also add at least one avatar style.

## HTTP API

You can also use our HTTP API, which generates avatars directly on our servers and requires no installation.
