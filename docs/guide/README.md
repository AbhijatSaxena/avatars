# Getting Started

Avatars is a powerful and flexible avatar generator. You can use Avatars to create user-generated avatars, deterministic avatars and random avatars. You can choose between different avatar styles: From classic identicons to lovely designed characters.

## User-generated

Most avatar styles allow you to choose each part and color individually. This allows you and your app users to create individual avatars. Additionally we provide a [user interface](./guide/extensions/user-interface). Try it out right now!

On the overview page of the [avatar styles](/guide/styles) you can find out which avatar styles allow an individual design.

## Deterministic

DiceBear Avatars allows you to create [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system) avatars from a seed. This makes avatars great for creating unique placeholder avatars for user identities. The same seed will always create the same avatar.

## Random

You want to create random avatars for your design or application? No problem! Basically the standard behaviour of avatars. If you like, you can download a set of randomly created avatars right here.
